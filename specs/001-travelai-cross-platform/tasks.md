# Tasks — TravelAI 2.0

Date 2026-11-06. User authorized the concrete six-step implementation proposal. Two known delivery checklist items remain open until evidence exists. Each task states requirements, dependencies, exact files and completion conditions. Tests precede behavior.

## Dependencies and independent acceptance

Setup -> foundations -> US1 -> US2 -> US4. US7 and US8 integrate the same canonical booking service. US5 and US6 require authenticated identities. US3 requires approved consent, data and model artifacts. Final evidence depends on all assigned platform journeys. Story independent tests use synthetic prerequisite fixtures.

Parallel opportunities after dependencies pass include US5 moderation tests, US6 participant tests and US3 consent tests in separate directories. Implementation is sequential in this task unless separately delegated.

## Implementation strategy

Complete the approved mobile repair first, then secure identity and original transactional checkout, then lifecycle and client integration. Continue all tracked stories and delivery evidence. A task is checked only after its stated tests pass. External data transfer and cloud deployment remain separately scoped.

## Execution evidence

Initial local baseline recorded in spec.md. Update this section with command results after each task.

T001 passed. Five design artifacts and contracts generated and reviewed. User authorization to proceed on known 21/23 delivery gate recorded in plan.md. Research agents completed read-only research.
T002 passed. Mobile `tsc --noEmit --incremental false` reproduced TS2322 at app-tabs.web.tsx:38 before the fix.

T003 passed. Mobile ref remains forwarded with Pressable-compatible native-element type. `npm run typecheck` exit 0.
T004 passed. Expo installed ESLint/config and local `EXPO_OFFLINE=1 CI=1 npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` both exit 0 after replacing hydration setState-in-effect with useSyncExternalStore. Dependency install reported 15 moderate advisory entries, to review without unrequested broad upgrades.
Policy baseline: 10 BookingPoliciesTest tests pass against isolated temporary PostgreSQL harness, evidence /tmp/travelai-backend-test-rzYs2Q/build/surefire-reports. PasswordHashesTest was executed red before implementation. Host JDK27 Lombok failure reproduced and isolated JDK21 validation configured without changing production Java25 default.

2026-11-06 implementation checkpoint. `scripts/test-backend.sh` completed all 21 tests with zero failures/errors against a new isolated PostgreSQL instance. Includes eight transaction/API cases, ten policy cases, two password cases and application context startup. Last report directory is recorded in /tmp/travelai-transaction-run.log. Synthetic concurrency checks cover last-seat holds and duplicate payment, expiry is tested exactly at the issued boundary, failed rescheduling preserves the original, successful change releases its old seat, and a 100 + 80 payment basis refunds 117 and retains 63. The initial transaction tests exposed persist-before-initialization errors, which were corrected and rerun.

Frontend and admin production builds both passed using temporary output directories. New opaque-session transport integration compiles. Mobile lint/typecheck passed earlier. Test runtime uses installed JDK21 with a command-line release override, production Java25 compatibility remains to be verified.

Foundation implementation remains incomplete. Additive SQL is authored but migration/legacy compatibility evidence is pending. Security still requires its full expiry/revocation/ownership matrix. Canonical booking API/service exists and passes the listed subset, but hotel/no-show/calendar/cutoff-policy version matrices, rollback fault injection, UI integration and all-platform delivery evidence remain open. Legacy booking mutations now return an explicit migration conflict to prevent bypassing canonical SIMULATED payment. The old checkout screen needs migration before it is usable with these protected endpoints. Existing legacy records remain readable through authorized GET routes. T006 and later tasks are deliberately unchecked except pure policy T007, whose direct test prerequisite passed.

Requirements checklist remains 21/23. No delivery or overall-completion checkbox changed. Expo dependency installation reported 15 moderate advisory entries that remain for dependency review.

2026-11-06 universal-client amendment. The user authorized consolidating the former traveler/admin Vite applications into apps/mobile for Web/Android/iOS and cleanup after migration. Legacy client path assignments above now point to their Expo replacements. Old source was archived locally before deletion. This migration does not close physical-device, AI evaluation, retention or performance requirements. The requirements checklist is unchanged. Updated verification evidence is in the repository README and the execution evidence below.

Universal migration verification completed on 2026-11-06. Backend `scripts/test-backend.sh` reports 30 tests, zero failures/errors. Client `npm run check` covers lint/typecheck plus nine direct transport/idempotency tests. Expo exported Web, Android and iOS bundles after removing the old clients and tutorial code. AI contract suite reports nine passing tests with mocked provider requests. Browser QA used a temporary PostgreSQL instance and synthetic accounts/catalog/cards. It verified login/session restoration, profile/balance data, tour inventory selection, explicit review disclosures and a SIMULATED 100,000 VND payment resulting in CONFIRMED. Recovery archive for removed source is /tmp/travelai-pre-universal-ki2r9g0d.tar.gz. Native physical-device journeys, broader delivery measurements and remaining FR matrices are still open. npm dependency audit retains 15 moderate advisory entries.

Compatibility follow-up. Existing short legacy passwords are migrated to PBKDF2 only after successful verification, while new/changed passwords retain the eight-character minimum. Administrator dashboard totals now include both canonical and legacy bookings.
